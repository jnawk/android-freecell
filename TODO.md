# TODO List for Android Freecell

## Game Logic
- [ ] Implement win condition check in `FreecellGameEngine.kt` (Issue #4)
  - Check if all foundation piles are complete (King on top for each suit)
- [x] Fix bug with card movements from free cells to tableau (Issue #3)
  - Queens in free cells cannot be moved to legal King positions in tableau
  - Jacks in free cells cannot be moved to legal Queen positions in tableau
- [ ] Implement supermoves (Issue #6)
  - Detect when multiple cards form a valid sequence (alternating colors, descending ranks)
  - Allow dragging the entire sequence as one unit
  - Validate that the destination can accept the sequence (enough free cells available)
  - Implement the "Freecell power move" formula: (# empty freecells + 1) Ã— 2^(# empty columns)
- [ ] Implement move counter (Issue #7)
  - Increment counter for each valid move
  - Display the counter in the UI
  - Reset counter when starting a new game
- [ ] Implement undo stack (Issue #8)
  - Store each move in an undo stack
  - Implement undo functionality to revert to previous game states
  - Provide a UI element to trigger undo
- [ ] Detect when a game is "stuck" (Issue #10)
  - Analyze the current game state to determine if any valid moves remain
  - Notify the player when they are stuck
  - Offer options (restart, new game, undo)

## UI Improvements
- [x] Fix clipping of cards at the bottom of tall tableau piles (Issue #1)
  - Implemented solution: Initially size the view to accommodate the maximum possible pile height (19 cards)
- [x] Fix issue with cards not being revealed properly when dragging (Issue #2)
  - When a card is dragged away, the card underneath is not revealed until the card is released
- [ ] Add "New Game" button (Issue #9)
  - Add a "New Game" button to the UI
  - Implement functionality to reset the game state and deal a new hand
  - Confirm with the player before abandoning the current game

## Configuration
- [ ] Configure data backup rules in `data_extraction_rules.xml` (Issue #5)
  - Use `<include>` and `<exclude>` to control what is backed up
